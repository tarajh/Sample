# Introduction
During the next year you will learn the fundamentals of data science.
Surviving the nine courses which make up the [Data Science
Specialization][0001] offered by [Johns Hopkins University][jhu] requires a
**strategy**.
To this end, the focus of the ten-course series including a capstone project
is to provide the learner with:
1. an introduction to the key ideas behind reproducible research,
2. an introduction to the tools and techniques to transform raw
data into a presentable report,
4. an opportunity to gain hands-on practice so you can learn the
techniques for yourself, and
3. an appreciation of the mathematics & statistics involved in
data science.
## Core Courses

* Data Scientist's Toolbox
* R Programming
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Getting and Cleaning Data
